# Build Week 4/15/2019 Jump Tracker

This is a static webpage created with HTML, CSS by means of LESS pre compiler, and Vanilla JavaScript.

Vanilla JS uses components, one a tab system that operates the pages naviagation, and a carousel that displays
the information about each member of the development team.

If you are unsure on how to use LESS please refer to http://lesscss.org/

If you are unsure how the JS components function. The semantic mark up with the html should allow you to understand the scafolding required to add or remove addiotional parts to the page easily. For the tabs component, you could add addiotional pages as well as additional menu tabs. 

For the Carousel, the same is true. Follow the naming conventions, and you can add or remove additional parts to that part of the page.

This is possible through DOM manipulation. Good luck! 

# What is my role

I was responsible for creating a static marketing webpage to display my knowledge on the content learned so far in my education with Lambda School.
I researched marketing pages before beginning the design process. After deciding upon a mock up, I began designing the webpage. 

- [ ]  Build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by my group and provides the user with details about the product my team has selected to build.
- [ ]  My marketing website includes responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. 
- [ ]  The call to action on the website includes a login button that links the user over to the React application that the Front End Architect has built.
- [ ]  My marketing website is hosted on the hosting platform "Netlify".
- [ ]  This Marketing site's home page has content that relates to the product that my team is working on.
- [ ]  Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would are key.

Full-Stack web application used for tracking and improving your vertical jump.

"Pitch: As a once talented athlete, I’ve realized I’m getting old and my body can’t do what it used to.  Desperate to get my baller skills back, I need to increase my vertical jump! 

MVP: 

Onboarding process for a user. Include data like height and current vertical clearance. Instructions on how to test your current vertical should be provided.  
Homepage to see what goals you have set recently, and a graph of your vertical jump height over time. 
Ability to set, edit, and delete a goal. Depending on how many inches you want to increase your vertical, it gives you a number of weeks it will take you to reach that goal.
Ability to set when you want to be reminded to complete your prescribed exercises and mark them as complete.  Marking a days’ exercise as complete triggers a modal with positive feedback on your milestones.
App will prompt you to re- test your vertical half way through the prescribed program length, and at the very end. User will enter the date of the test and the result. 
After program is complete, user will choose a designated time period to continue to be reminded to recheck their vertical clearance for maintenance. 
Example vertical jump program you could integrate: https://www.stack.com/a/an-8-week-training-program-for-a-higher-vertical-jump

Stretch: Add a social aspect to see a friends recent goals and progress, or challenge a friend to increase their vertical jump alongside you.
